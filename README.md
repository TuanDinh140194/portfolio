# Getting Started with My Portfolio React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This is my Portfolio React App. I have use React and Tailwind CSS for this project. This project include Top Nav Bar
for the navigation to particular section in the web page. The side bar on the left is the link to my social media as well as my resume and my github page. This website is the single-page website with different sections on the page.

First, the About section is for introduce me, the Skills section is show all of my technologies that I have experience. Third, the project section is all of my current projects. Finally, the contact form is used to contact to me for work. The users can input message and it will send directly to my email. I have used the https://app.getform.io/ third party to link my contact form with my email. 

## Run local
### Available Scripts 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
